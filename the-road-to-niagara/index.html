            <p><span>In</span> the heart of New Jersey, where bagels are born tough and traditions run deep, one man dared to break free. Leaving behind the familiar streets, he set out on a journey west, to the wilds of California—a land where the sun shines bright, and the waves crash hard, but where the perfect bagel was as elusive as a mirage.</p>

            <p>In a small, unassuming kitchen, he took on the challenge. No recipe too tricky, no batch too burnt. With the grit of a gunslinger and the patience of a saint, he wrestled with the dough, cold-proofing it for 36 hours, hand-rollin’ each one like it was his last, and boiling them to perfection before lettin’ them face the heat of the oven.</p>
                
            <p>This is the tale of a bagel outlaw, a man who wouldn’t back down until he’d mastered his craft. From the streets of Jersey to the coast of California, his journey was long, but every step brought him closer to perfection. Now, after a thousand miles and a million twists of dough, his creation stands ready to face the world.</p>
                
            <p>The Road to Niagara is a story of persistence, passion, and a pursuit that knows no bounds. And when you take that first bite, you’ll know — it was all worth it.</p>
